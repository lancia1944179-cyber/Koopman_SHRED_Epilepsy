# Koopman_SHRED_Epilepsy
This is the implementation, utilities and testing code base for the paper **"Koopman-SHRED Sparse Identification of Epileptic neural dynamics"**.

*<< Explicit resolution and analysis of highly complex nonlinear dynamical systems has been partially exploited in years of traversal research, introducing increasingly good linear approximate solutions, the Koopman operator among others; still, formal identification of such systems remains a challenge common to every relevant field of engineering, assuming extreme relevance within control theory applications. The way generalized epilepsy-related phenomena have been studied is a perfect example of how good results can be archived in spite of incomplete knowledge, but lead to the affirmation of different parallel models, with their respective pro and cons. In this paper, a recent (artificial) intelligent and fully data- driven framework, SINDy-SHRED, is tested in the identification of a sparse linear surrogate dynamic of a set of epileptic neuronal populations, both in its classical learning and real-time integration. >>*
